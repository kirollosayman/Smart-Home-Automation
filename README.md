# Smart-Home-Automation
Design and implement a smart home system that automates the control of lighting and fan speed based on environmental conditions. The project uses an ATmega32, LM35, LDR, Flame sensor, and a PWM-controlled motor. An LCD, and an H-bridge circuit controls the fan motor. Additionally, LEDs indicate varying light intensity levels
